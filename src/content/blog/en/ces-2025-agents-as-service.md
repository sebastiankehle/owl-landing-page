Old World Labs (OWL) is thrilled to unveil its revolutionary "Agents as a Service" technology at CES 2025, showcasing its seamless integration into humanoid robots and virtual environments. This cutting-edge innovation positions OWL at the forefront of the rapidly evolving agent-driven robotics market, redefining the potential of AI in both physical and digital spaces.

## Experience the Future of Humanoid Robotics and AI at Booth #8777

OWL’s latest advancements enable AI agents to seamlessly inhabit and operate humanoid robots, allowing them to reason, interact, and adapt to 3D environments in real-time. These agents are not confined to robotics alone but extend their capabilities into virtual worlds, enabling a unified AI presence across physical and digital realms. Visitors to booth #8777 can engage directly with these agents in humanoid robots, on screens, and within virtual platforms—all connected by OWL’s groundbreaking "Replicants" system.

## Meet the First Self-Replicating Agent System

Debuting at CES, OWL’s Replicants technology combines AI-driven reasoning with resource-aware robotics, setting a new benchmark for sustainable and scalable automation. Replicants empower humanoid robots to function as intelligent, autonomous entities capable of adapting to complex tasks while seamlessly interfacing with virtual environments. This integration bridges the gap between physical robotics and immersive digital experiences, bringing AI agents to life like never before.

> “CES 2025 is an opportunity to showcase how Old World Labs is redefining AI and robotics. With Replicants, we’re introducing self-replicating agents that extend AI capabilities beyond traditional boundaries. By integrating agents into humanoid robots and virtual worlds, we’re paving the way for accessible, adaptive, and scalable solutions across industries,” said Nick Liverman. “Our mission is to empower people and organizations with intelligent systems that can operate in the real world and virtual environments alike.” - Nick Liverman
